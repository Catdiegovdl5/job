**Subject: SP Real Estate CEOs - Stop Waiting. Get Contacts.**

You need a definitive list of CEO contacts for real estate firms in São Paulo. Yesterday. You're leaving money on the table without it.

My stack is built for this: Python, Scrapy, and BeautifulSoup, backed by Requests for direct API calls and Selenium for any stubborn, JavaScript-heavy sites. I don't just extract; I *conquer* web data. Anti-scraping measures are obstacles, not roadblocks. You get accurate, actionable data, not just a promise.

If you're serious about getting these contacts fast and accurately, stop reading. Let's cut to the chase and discuss delivery. My calendar is open for those who want results, not delays.
