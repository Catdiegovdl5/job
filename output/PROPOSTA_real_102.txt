**You need the direct contacts for every real estate CEO in São Paulo, and you need them yesterday.** Forget cold calls and LinkedIn dead ends. The data is out there.

My arsenal is built for this: `Requests` for raw speed, `BeautifulSoup` for surgical parsing, and `Selenium` to smash through any JavaScript-driven walls. Data will be pristine, formatted via `Pandas`, with intelligent proxy rotation and retry logic ensuring no lead escapes.

Your competitors aren't waiting. Stop talking, start acting. DM me. Let's get this done.
